# t800desktoy

This is the code i used for my desktop toy. Its a t800 terminator head with 5mm leds fitted into eyes. 
The code has 7 led blink effects and it makes use of a pir sensor connected to arduino. 
once motion is detected it will randomly play one of the 7 led blink effects.

two leds are connected to pin 3 and pin 5 on arduino nano (these pins has pwm)
The motion sensor is on pin 2

of course the leds has 325ohm resistors on them too. 

pretty simple
